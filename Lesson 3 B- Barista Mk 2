2- Robot asks, and remembers, how many coffees you'd like
3- Robot gives you the total cost of your coffees

print("Hello! Welcome to our coffee shop!")

name = input("What's your name?: ")

print("Hello " + name + ", thank you for coming in today.\n")

menu = ("Black coffee, Capachino, Latte- ")

order = input(name + ", what would you like from our menu today? Here's what we're serving-\n" + menu)
price = 3

quantity = input("Ok, how many " + order + "'s would you like?: ")

#"price * quantity" doesn't work, it just prints out whatever number I give for the quantity 3 times
#That's because any data taken from the input function is a string, so I need to change it it an int somehow

total = price * int(quantity)

#"typeerror" means ther's a problem with the 'type' of data you're trying to use
#total starts as an int, so using the same method as quantity to switch it to a string is the way to go.
print("\nThank you " + name + ", your " + quantity + " " + order + "'s will be ready in just a minute. The cost comes to Â£" + str(total))
