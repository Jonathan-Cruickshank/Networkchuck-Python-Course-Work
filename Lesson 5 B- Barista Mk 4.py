#Task One- If the customer is named "Ben" AND they answer "Yes" to "Are you evil?" don't let them continue
#Task Two- If the cucstomer is named Ben and they answer "no" give them a special message
#Task Three- Use "if" statement to give one item a different price to the others
#Task Four- Let customers choose extras that change the price

#Nested "if" statements are handy to establish if multiple things are true
