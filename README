I need a solid foundation of all the Python basics, so I'm following NetworkChuck's free course. 10 videos between 10 and 20 minutes, all about 2 years old but I don't think Python's changed much in that time.

Doing this was inspired by me getting sick of always having to look the syntax for loops every time I wanted one. Rote memorisation isn't that useful for coding languages but a certain amount can streamline the process. I'm hoping that by doing this course I'll get that solid foundation and by the end have generated some good flashcards and notes on common code snippets so I can have that foundation memorised and on hand whenever I need it.
